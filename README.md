# **Vision Statement**

_To make creating plans a thing of the past._

According to the [Gitnux Market Data Report in 2023](https://blog.gitnux.com/time-management-statistics/#:~:text=82%25%20of%20people%20don%27t%20have%20a%20time%20management%20system&text=It%27s%20a%20proven%20method%20of,matrix%20and%20the%20Pomodoro%20method.), less than 1 in 5 people (18%) have a proper time management system. Workers feel less motivated which results in lower profits for businesses as productivity dwindles. This illustrates the ever-growing battle against time. If left unchecked, the problem will have detrimental effects on society.

Using the latest technology in Python and artificial intelligence, we will create an interactive chatbot that makes a personal daily schedule to cater to their work, education, and life necessities. 

For each activity the user enters, they will be asked questions such as “Is there a time limit associated with the task? If so, what is it?” and “Do you need to be at a specific location?” to understand more about the activity. After specifying their list of daily tasks with details, the chatbot will return an organized planner with the purpose of improving the lives of the users with an efficient and convenient plan.
